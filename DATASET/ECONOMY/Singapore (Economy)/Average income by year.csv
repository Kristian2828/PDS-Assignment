"Data refer to resident employed households. A resident employed household refers to a household where the household reference person is a resident (i.e. Singapore citizen or permanent resident), and with at least one working person. Household income from work refers to the sum of income received by working members of the household from employment and business. However, it does not include the income of maids. Household income from work includes employer Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of annual bonus. Data on household income from work refers to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise. The dollar values are in nominal terms. More data and analyses on household income from work can be found in the paper 'Key Household Income Trends, 2020'.

"The deciles are derived based on the ranking of resident employed households by their monthly household income from work per household member (including employer CPF contributions). It is notable, for example, that some resident employed households in the lowest 10% owned a car (13.9%), employed a maid (13.5%), lived in private property (7.6%) or were with household reference persons aged 65 years and over (30.0%) in 2020.  It is also important to recognise that not all households are consistently in the same decile group from one year to the next.  For example, an employed household may move down from a higher decile in a particular year due to the temporary unemployment of a household member, before moving up the deciles when the member resumes work in the subsequent year.  In comparing the performance of any particular decile group over time, it is therefore relevant to note that the comparison may not pertain to the same group of households.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gini Coefficient:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Gini coefficient measures the degree of inequality of the income distribution. It is equal to zero in the case of total income equality and to one in the case of total inequality. The more unequal the income distribution, the larger would be the Gini coefficient. Internationally, there are differences in computation methods adopted by different countries, although the basic concept of Gini remains the same. These differences make international comparison of Gini coefficient difficult. One major difference is in the equivalence scale adopted. Equivalence scales take into account economies of scale within the household, and adjust for household size so that households with different sizes and compositions can be analysed comparably. There are different scales used by different countries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Household Income from Work:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Household income from work refers to the sum of income received by working/employed members of the household from employment and business. However, it does not include the income of domestic workers. Monthly household income from work includes one-twelfth of the annual bonus. Data refers to household income from work before accounting for Government transfers and taxes, unless stated otherwise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modified OECD Scale:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The modified OECD scale assigns the first adult in the household a weight of 1 point, and each additional adult a weight of 0.5 points and each child a weight of 0.3 points. The equivalised household income is derived by dividing the total household income by the sum of the points allocated to the household members. For example, a household comprising 2 adults and 2 children would have a sum total of 2.1 points. If the household has income from work of $4,000, then the equivalised household income would be $1,905 (i.e. $4,000 divided by 2.1). The modified OECD scale is used by Eurostat and countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Square Root Scale:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the square root scale, individuals are ranked by their household income on a ‘per equivalised member basis’, which is derived by dividing household income by the square root of household size. For example, based on the square root scale, a household of 4 having income from work of $4,000 would have an equivalised household income of $2,000 (i.e. $4,000 divided by the square root of 4). Individuals such as children and maids would also be ranked. The square root scale is used by Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in its major reports on inequality.
